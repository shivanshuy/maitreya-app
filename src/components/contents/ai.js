    text: 'We can loosely define the progression of AI in terms of evolution of its different categories. Traditional AI was mainly rules based AI where we tried to lay down all the rules of the game. And System was following prdefined Rules. Obviously it was not sufficient beacuse we were after full proof and perfect algorithms. But thats not how humans learn. Then came Machine Learninhg were we tried to teach machines to learn and adopt according to data. Its broadly of 3 categoried - Supervised Learning where system is trained based on pre labled data. In Unsupervised Learning Sytem learns on unlabeled data and tries to identify patterns and relation in data own its own. In Reinforcement Learning System tries to choose the corect path using feedback in Dynamic Environment.'
