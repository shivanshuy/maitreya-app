    text: 'In machine learning, the term stochastic parrot is a metaphor to describe the theory that large language models, though able to generate plausible language, do not understand the meaning of the language they process. AI systems use statistical relationships learned from massive datasets to convincingly generate human-like text, while lacking true semantic understanding behind the word patterns. The term was coined by Emily M. Bender in the 2021 artificial intelligence research paper "On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?".',
